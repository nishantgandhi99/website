I am vivid writer, love live music and pumping iron in gym. Working as a software engineer at DataRobot to earn my livings. 

I have a masters degree in Computer Science and Engineering from **Indian Institute of Technology-Patna** (class of 2015) and earned my second graduate degree in Information Systems program at **Northeastern University** (class of 2019).

I am an investor in startup called <a href="http://www.patistic.com" target="_blank">Patistic Innovations</a> which I also ran for initial 5 months.
