Today I attended the talk by Chris Quintero of Bolt VC at my university. The Bolt VC focuses on hardware product startups which are into the early stage of product development. Among many topics, one we discussed was on sales operation of B2B and B2C startups.

To start with,

    B2B sales are different than B2C. 

**B2B:**

The B2B sales decision are made rationally. The engagement process is slow and long with prospects. The sales happen because someone knows someone or someone made the connection with someone. The company has to heavily invest in the sales team.

**B2C:**

The B2C sales decision are not made purely rationally. The profit is really into quantity and the company has to invest a lot in marketing. The operations is a challenging part here because B2C company need to scale to reach good profit.
