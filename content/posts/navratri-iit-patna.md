If I were to pick the single achievement of mine during my days at IIT Patna, 
it would be organizing the Navratri Festival. 

Below is the full dramatic story about how an idea, after going through difficult challenges, finally becomes reality.

It is not about my love for this festival. <br/>
Although I recognize Navratri as one of the most amazing festival.<br/>
But being an introvert in my childhood and teenage days, I rarely participated in Navratri festival.<br/>
So one would ask, *If Navratri is not your thing than why you would go extreme to organize it in IIT Patna?*<br/>

I have also asked same question to my self. <br/>
*Why I went though all of it?* The question was also my attempt to understand myself better.<br/>

When I deeply think about it, it has something to do with my desire to be challenged. <br/>
It is also about knowing that something does not exist and be the first to make it exist. <br/>
I have always liked fame more than money and everything that I do, made me more famous or known through out the campus. <br/> 
That always boosted my confidence to do more challenging and complicated stuffs where no-one is looking. <br/>
**The idea where no-one is looking**, is very important for me.  <br/>
I mean there were challenging stuffs like organizing core annual fest or other signature events of IIT Patna. <br/>
But, everyone is looking at it and competing for the opportunity to be an organizer and I was not interested in those challenges. <br/> 
So, What I did as a part of annual fest organizer is introducing new events and gave opportunity to fresher students to help me manage them. <br/>
Very few organizers looked at fresher students and gave them challenging work.  <br/>
So, I took the opportunity and I earned huge respect and affection from them that they all arranged special farewell party for me when I was about to leave college. <br/> 
They made huge handmade farewell card for me and wrote their wishes for me on it. <br/>
 
  
More or less, the same things inspired made me to establish other clubs at IIT Patna like *LinuxCult*, *Hackers Club*, *PG Affairs* and *People of IIT Patna*.
