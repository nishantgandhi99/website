I had best time of my life while I was studing Computer Science at [Indian Institute of Technology Patna](https://www.iitp.ac.in/). The best part of studing at one of the most prestigious educational institution was not only about solving the design and engineering chanllenges. I also learned about people skills and human psychology. The understanding of individual interest and expectation to make best out of it. The whole paradigm shift from thinking naively to understanding that every action has consequences and no action is also an action. It has trasformed me from introvert geek to intellectual individual.

I have created list of quotes/ideas by people at IIT Patna that I cherish.
