My first proper article, which I published on a platform called Medium, was "What is your idea of bad dream?". 
I had never wrote anything of that sort before. 
I had a tech blog where I used to write about how to fix tech issues that I resolved for my self.

The idea of writing this article came during my depressing days at Chennai. 
I had lot of bad dreams and they were staying in my head and hunted me a lot. 
One such afternoon when I woke up with bad dream, I was feeling so worst that I finally wrote it down. 
My first draft was so messy. But every time I read it, I felt some kind of peace. 
I kept on correcting typos, grammar and narration flow while reading.
When I felt comfortable with sharing it to people, I sent it to all my close friends to know their opinion on my article.
I also added couple of lines from their inputs.

The link below will take you to the article which I published on medium.
