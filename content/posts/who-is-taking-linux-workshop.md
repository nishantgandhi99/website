At IIT Patna, I made few of the best memories of my life. We were first student batch of Master's(M.Tech.) in Computer Science & Engineering Degree program at IIT Patna. We were only 13 all boys in our batch.

At that time, we started **IEEE Student Branch**, the student club dedicated to computer science activities. My friend **Vikram Singh** from our batch took this initiative of starting club and also became first president of the club.

So after all paper work and permissions, we were official and allowed to organize events. We decided to organize an Inauguration Ceremony for our IEEE Student Branch club. We decided to go with few events and guest talks. After planning and some ground work, we started our marketing campaign. We visited from every college of Patna to news medias for spreading words out about Inauguration Ceremony of IEEE Student Branch of IIT Patna and participation tickets.

We had setup online event registration website for getting the participation count for each event. One of the event was **Linux Workshop** which I was going to deliver.

So one the day of an event, we had huge queue of participants at venue. We had setup the registration desk with welcome-kit and complementary coffee for all our participants. As we were only 11 boys trying to run full show, we were doing all kind of work based on our availability and commitments with other events. Now, my workshop was in evening and I was not involved into first welcome speech so I was there filling coffee cups for participants at registration desk. Than one of my batchmate come close to me and told me that we have higgest participation count in my Linux Workshop and I must deliver best.

Here is the funny incident happened.

One of out team member was stopped by one participant near the registration desk. That individual was all well dressed up and excited as he was going to be part of the event that is being organized in one of the most prestigious technical institute of India.

In those excited moment of him he asked to our team member,

 *"I am very excited to be here and specially interested in this Linux Workshop event. Can you tell me who is the speaker? Is it posible that I can meet him?"*

 Our team member showing his fingure towards me and told him,

 *"Can you see that guy next to registration desk who is distributing coffee to everyone?"*

 He said,

 *"yes."*

 Again our team member,

*"He is the guy going to take your Linux Workshop."*

**And both of them bust out laughing.**

Later that team member told me whole incident and we again laughed.

This is the life of IIT Patna. **At one instance you are distributing the coffee and other instance you are educating class of 200 people on Linux Operating System.**
