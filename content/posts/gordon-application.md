One of the reason I choose to join Northeastern University over other Universities is "Gordon Engineering Leadership" program, which I can take along with my regular MS degree. <br/>
So, once I received admit letter from Northeastern University for MS in Information Systems program, I applied for GEL program, being interviewed and accepted for Gordon Fellow 2018 Batch. <br/>

During the application process, I was asked to fill up answers for few questions. <br/>
Here they are.!!! <br/>

**Describe your special strengths or areas of expertise**  
I have been trained as a software engineer specialized in Big Data Processing.  
I also have relative industry experience.  
I can process, manage and persist data of any variety, quantity and quality to get meaning full insights out of it.   
I also consider myself as an effective communicator.  
My biggest social strength is empathy which helps me to connect with people of any age and social background.   
My biggest asset is my network. 

**Outline any recent engineering activities (design, development, production, field service, etc.)**   
At my last employment,  
I was a part of the team which designed and implemented Big Data Warehousing platform for analytics which produces fast query result irrespective of the size of data.   
I participated in hackathon,  
organized and sponsored by Paypal where we build custom software solution for one NGO to solve their loan management problem & reduce defaulters.   

**Describe your engineering leadership experience**  
In my last grad school,  
I pioneered the hacking event where competitors are asked to hack different computers and websites setup by us.   
The whole online platform for the competition was built by first-year undergrad students under my leadership.  
During my last employment, under my leadership, our team built software product which let our clients extract data from any social media and online discussion forum. I also interviewed and picked the interns, who built prototype tools for my company, under my mentor-ship.    

**Outline your objectives in attending the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program**   
I have already bootstrapped my company which provides services in big data & cloud.  
My ambition is to make my company market leader in the domain of big data & cloud services.   
But my limited experience & exposure is holding me from carrying out big projects and taking bold decisions.    
I want to attend GEL program so that I can learn and inspire from my instructors as well as batch mates to reduce my shortcoming as a leader.   
I want to be part of the community of the extraordinary mindset people on northeastern campus which can help me nurtures my leadership skills.  

**Describe any extracurricular activities (sports, hobbies, volunteerism, etc.)**  
I love reading non-fiction books.  
I regularly go to the gym to stay fit.  
I often participate in weekend hackathons.   
I am an occasional writer on the topic of human behavior and psychology.   
I also try my hand on guitar whenever possible.
