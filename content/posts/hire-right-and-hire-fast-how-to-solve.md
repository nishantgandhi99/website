You want to hire fast to build your product but also don't want to bring in people who might be bad culture fit.
Finding people with right culture-fit takes time. So how you solve the problem of hire fast and hire right at same time?

My solution, think out side box.
Get expandable team to buy more time for right hire. outsource some work or hire freelancers/contract workers.
Those people are not going to stay and very less likely to effect culture in long lasting way.
Meanwhile, take time to search for right candidate.
