Psychology has always been my area of interest. 
How human thinks, behave and respond to the environment is the puzzle I try to solve all the time.
Every person is different but there are more similarity than differences.
Most of the people are driven by similar instincts and that makes it easy to understand them.
By understanding them, you can set the right expectations from them. 
You can setup right reward that motivates them to do things. 
And most of the times, it is pleasure to correctly predict the actions by people on given the set of situations. 

In the article below, I am trying to scratch the surface of human behavior by seven sins, which I think are also mentioned in Bible.
