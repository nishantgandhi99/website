My days at chennai were not so easy. 
I always felt depressed for some unknown reasons. 
Plus, I did not had any friend to whom I can really open up. 
Being alone gives you so much time for your self.
Time to think. 
Time to analyse everything 
and when you are full of thoughts and no one around to share, 
you start writing them.
That is how I started writing. 
Inspiration for my articles comes from my own experiences and how I analyse those experiences.

My first article was about "Bad Dreams". 

**Spoiler Alert: if you have not read my article on bad-dreams, please read it first before reading further**

I was experiencing it a lot. 
The perfect utopian world of mine. 
I experienced being in that perfect and happy world. 
It just seem so much real in my dream while I was asleep. 
But it shattered me everytime I wake up in my bed. And realizing that it was illusion all along. 
I was so much depressed that I finally decided to write it down in my quest to find some kind of salvation from it.

Sharing my experiences and thoughts on my blog, brought me some kind of peace. So I kept writing.

Sharing on blog is very different thing than sharing with a person.
And there are reasons why we are not comfortable in expressing our thought to any person directly.  
Because, we have the fear of being judged. <br/>
What would other person think about us and how will they see us? <br/>
Lot of people says that it should not matter how other people think about you, But I don't agree with them. <br/> 
I think it matters. It matters because people treat you the way they see you. <br/>
They see you weak, broken and vulnerable; they walk over you. 
And if they not; you fear that they don't see you the same way as they used to.  


Sharing on blog takes away those insecurities for some reason. 
May be because it is open to world but hardly anyone gone read that. 
And even someone read it, they won't take it much seriously. 
Reading someone's thoughts are not same as watching them expressing it in there vulnerable moments.

So, Here I am sharing my thoughts and experiences which probably no body cares about.
