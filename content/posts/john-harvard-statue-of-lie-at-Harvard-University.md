The statue of John Harvard has been one of the major attraction for tourists visiting Harvard University. Everyone touch the foot of John Harvard status as popular belief that it brings good luck for getting admission in Harvard University. Very little they know about the lies engraved on the signature statue of University whose tag line is *Veritas*, meaning Truth.

The statue is also known by locals as Statue of lies. Here are most famous three lies around the statue of John Harvard.

**Lie 1:**<br/>
When the statue was created, there were no pictures of John Harvard known to exist. A student named Sherman Hoar was chosen randomly and dressed in the style of the seventeenth century so he could model for the statue. The project was executed by Mr Daniel Chester French.

**Lie 2:**<br/>
John Harvard was not the founder of the college.  The Massachusetts Bay Colony had established the college.  It was only later named after John Harvard, who had been an early financial contributor to the college. <br/>

**Lie 3:**<br/>
