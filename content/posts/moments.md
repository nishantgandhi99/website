Everyone of us have those moments. <br/> 

Moments when we feel lonely. <br/>
Moments when we feel ignored. <br/> 
Moments when we feel weak. <br/>
Moments when we feel vulnerable. <br/>
 
Sometimes for an hour. <br/>
Sometimes for a day. <br/>

And we need, <br/> 
someone to stay with us on those moments. <br/> 
To help us let our feeling come out. <br/>
Someone to talk with us. <br/>
To tell us everything will be fine. <br/>
 
If you have that person who gives you shelter in your weak moments, never ever leave them. <br/> 
Not everyone is lucky enough to have such person in their life. <br/>
