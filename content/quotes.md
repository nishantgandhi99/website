**Aaron Swartz:** “I think deeply about things and want others to do likewise. I work for ideas and learn from people. I don’t like excluding people. I’m a perfectionist, but I won’t let that get in the way of publication. Except for education and entertainment, I’m not going to waste my time on things that won’t have an impact. I try to be friends with everyone, but I hate it when you don’t take me seriously. I don’t hold grudges, it’s not productive, but I learn from my experience. I want to make the world a better place.”

**Dr Mahathir Mohamad, ex Prime Minister of Malaysia:** "Don’t overeat!!! My mother used to tell me to stop eating when food is tasty. There is a tendency for people over a certain age to become obese. They have a big stomach and to satisfy themselves, they drink and they overeat, which places a burden on their heart. I have been about 62-64 (kg) for years. I can wear my clothing made 30 years ago!"

**Vinod Khosla:** "Good isn't good enough; great is barely acceptable."
