<h1> Story of NPÂ Problems</h1>

**NP:**

+ Solvable in Polynomial time by Non-deterministic Turing Machine
+ Instance where answer is verifiable

**NP- Hard:**

+ At least as hard as the hardest problem in NP
+ every problem L in NP can be reduced to problem H in polynomial time
+ Not every NP is NP Hard
+ Solution can not be verified easily
