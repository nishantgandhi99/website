Lie 1: When the statue was created, there were no pictures of John Harvard known to exist. A student named Sherman Hoar was chosen randomly by French and dressed in the style of the seventeenth century so he could model for the statue.

Lie 2: John Harvard was not the founder of the college.  The Massachusetts Bay Colony had established the college.  It was only later named after John Harvard, who had been an early financial contributor to the college.

Lie 3: The college was actually founded in 1636 not 1638 as the inscription claims.
