<h1>process of thinking is like dry running algorithms. You have some assumptions, some input knowledge and you run simulation on possible outcome on them. Because it is so much information, that you can hold in your head, you need to remove all thoughts to make space of the problem you are working on. The more complex the simulation and more information you need, the more you need to remove other thoughts</h1>
