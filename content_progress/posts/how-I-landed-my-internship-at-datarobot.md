Summer was close and I was still searching for my summer Internship. I had applied for many companies and the one which eventually extended me offer was DataScience Product Startup called DataRobot.
I had heard about this company through one of their employee to whom I met about 8 months ago at Boston Startup Week event.
There were 3 rounds of engineering interviews.

First Round: (with Brian Bell Jr)
The first round was about finding out if I am a good fit for company and role. That basically means, if I can code in Python and have some experience around data science libraries. The google hangout call started with small introduction. Brian asked me to tell him about my project work and past experience with python. I had couple of projects that I mentioned in my resume, so I re iterated them and then I told him, "Either you can ask me more questions on python or I can show you the recent project I was working on."
