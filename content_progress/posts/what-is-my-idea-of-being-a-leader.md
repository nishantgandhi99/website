<h1>What is my idea of being a leader?<h1>
<date> mar 7<date>
+ Sometimes it is not about taking bring spot and lead on every possible situations, but give others the chance to lead and take bright spot.
+ When team wins, credit goes to team. When team loss, blame is you to carry. Embrace this idea.
+ Present opportunity to take on challenging task and trust them with the capability to finish it. Make them feel that you got their back if things go wrong. 
+ Provide motivation for doing things. Put right purpose which is more than money. Make them feel important part of whatever journey you are on.
