<h1> The society</h1>
<date> April 1st <date>
The society and culture is not organic. It is designed and shaped by those who are in power to fit their own view of the world. Specifically their idea of right and wrong. 
I was thinking about alternative society.
The alternative society where there is no concept of marriage. The woman choose to mate with anyone for the purpose of reproduction and keep the child to let family lineage alive.
There are so many implications. The woman is now center of family and not man. Desire is more toward to giving a birth to baby girl instead of boy because of ability to keep the family lineage continue. In some sense this seems more simple idea of society than whole complication of marriage and woman moving in to man’s home etc.
